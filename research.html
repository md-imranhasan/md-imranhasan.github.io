    <h2>Research Experiences</h2>

    <h3>Computational Drug Discovery & Disease Modeling</h3>
    <p>During my undergraduate studies, I participated in multiple research projects integrating computational and experimental methods to address biomedical challenges. Below are some key projects:</p>

    <h4>1. **COVID-19 & Mucormycosis Co-Infection Research**</h4>
    <p>
      Investigated the therapeutic potential of **Galangin** for COVID-19 and Mucormycosis co-infection. This research identified key host signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms targeted by Galangin, showcasing its role in reducing inflammation and tissue damage.
    </p>

    <h4>2. **AI-Driven Colorectal Cancer Detection**</h4>
    <p>
      Developed a **deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based system** for histopathological image analysis, achieving **99.80% accuracy** in detecting colon adenocarcinoma. This highlights the potential of AI-powered diagnosis in pathology.
    </p>

    <h4>3. **Systems Biology Approach to Multi-Disease Interactions**</h4>
    <p>
      Explored the molecular links between **Type 2 Diabetes, Tuberculosis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis** using systems biology. Identified key regulatory networks and therapeutic targets to guide future drug development.
    </p>

    <h4>4. **Blood-Based Transcriptomics for COVID-19**</h4>
    <p>
      Conducted an in-depth transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from **COVID-19 patients** to identify differentially expressed genes and pivotal protein pathways. The findings contribute to better disease monitoring and targeted therapies.
    </p>

    <h4>5. **AI-Assisted Diagnosis of Black Fungal Infections**</h4>
    <p>
      Designed a **transfer learning-based CNN model** to detect black fungal infections. Optimized architectures like **Xception**, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for infectious diseases.
